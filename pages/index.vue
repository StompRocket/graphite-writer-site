        <p>From the beginning Graphite Writer was primarily focused on speed, that holds true in this latest version.
          Because Graphite Writer is designed for note taking, we focused on just what is necessary, a more focused and
          fast experience.</p>

        <h1>About Graphite Writer</h1>
        <p>We started Graphite Writer to solve a problem. When we tried to take notes during class on Google Docs the
          teacher would start lecturing before it loaded, preventing us from taking effective notes. Version one of
          Graphite Writer solved this problem. We were able to take notes with speed and ease, but there still wasn't
          and easy way to search and organize them. Graphite Writer version two aims to solve this problem. We have
          spent months researching and designing custom machine learning algorithms to help you find what you need, when
          you need it.</p>
